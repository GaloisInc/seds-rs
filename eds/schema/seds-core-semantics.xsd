				<xs:annotation>
					<xs:documentation>An analog to digital count is a number produced by an analog-to-digital converter to measure a physical quantity.  The measurement action counts the time for the measurement transducer to reach equilibrium.
A count represents a quantity kind that depends upon the analog process that is being measured.  For this reason, the association between count and quantity kind should ideally not be fully specified in this ontology, but should wait until the time of describing a particular device.  However, that specification may require additional syntax in a schema.  The current strategy in this ontology is to leave the specification of quantity kind to the point of description of a device, and to expect the additional syntax in the schema that uses this concept.  The alternative is to define a subclass of AToDCount for each quantity kind.  The delayed specification of quantity kind may provide a model to simplify the definition of other units.
Typically, a count will be the basis for a conversion-based unit that converts the count into a physical quantity.</xs:documentation>

			<xs:documentation>The “coordinate type” term indicates how to interpret a semantic type that is an array of coordinates.  The arrays to which the coordinate type applies may be interpreted as locations in a phase space, such as position and velocity vectors.  For arrays that may be interpreted as transformation from one frame to another, such as quaternions and direction cosine matrices, the transformation type applies.
The “coordinate type” term specifies a particular combination of the following terms:
•	coordinate system
•	array size
•	unit of measure
•	reference frame
Some of the terms listed above may be incompletely determined by a “coordinate type” value, and so must be specified in an electronic data sheet with that “coordinate type” value when defining an item of data.  Those terms above that are completely determined by a “coordinate type” value need not be specified with that value in an electronic data sheet.  The definition of a value of the “coordinate type” term in the dictionary of terms must provide the information about the terms listed above.
In an electronic data sheet this term is the “coordinateType” attribute of a data item.

Interpret a semantic type that is an array of numbers.</xs:documentation>

In an electronic data sheet, this term is the “statusConvention” attribute of a data item.
Use Cases:

			<xs:enumeration value="binaryStatus">
				<xs:annotation>
					<xs:documentation>The binary status convention indicates whether a device is functioning correctly or erroneously.  The data item has the value 0 if no error is being detected, and it has the value 1 if an error is present.  Typically, the binary representation of such a variable would be bit or unsigned integer.
Use Cases:
The SOIS accelerometer interface uses this convention to report device status.</xs:documentation>

					<xs:documentation>The quality fraction status convention indicates a fractional quality of service, with zero representing complete failure and 1 representing completely successful operation.  The method of computing this value is an algorithm that varies from device to device, and is explained in natural language in an unstructured text field in an electronic data sheet.
Use Cases:
Specify the quality of data produced by a star tracker.</xs:documentation>

	<xs:simpleType name="transformationType">
		<xs:annotation>
			<xs:documentation>The “transformation type” term indicates how to interpret a semantic type that is an array of numbers.  The arrays to which the transformation type applies may be interpreted as transformation from one frame to another, such as quaternions and direction cosine matrices.  For arrays that may be interpreted as locations in a phase space, such as position and velocity vectors, the coordinate type applies.  A coordinate type that is a vector may be treated as a transformation by adding it to other vectors, for example; such a transformation would be a called a translation.
The “transformation type” term specifies a particular combination of the following terms:
•	coordinate system
•	array size
•	unit of measure
•	computation
The definition of a value of the “transformation type” term must provide the information about the terms listed above.  The “reference frame” and “to frame” must be specified with the transformation type in an electronic data sheet when defining an item of data. 
In an electronic data sheet this term is the “transformationType” attribute of a data item.
Use Cases:
Interpret the quaternion that is emitted by a star tracker.</xs:documentation>

•	coordinate system = rectangular
•	array size = (n, n), row-major order
•	unit of measure is not applicable
•	the transformation is computed by matrix multiplication
The elements of the matrix are interpreted as direction cosines.</xs:documentation>

•	coordinate system = Cartesian.
•	array size = 4.
•	unit of measure is not applicable
•	the transformation is computed by conjugation
The four coordinates are a scalar first, followed by three vector coordinates, corresponding to the orthogonal Cartesian coordinate axes x, y, and z, with the same chirality as the coordinate system.  Chirality of the coordinate system must be specified in an electronic data sheet when using this term.

			<xs:enumeration value="rollPitchYaw">
				<xs:annotation>
					<xs:documentation>The “roll-pitch-yaw” value of the “transformation type” term specifies the following information for a semantic type:
•	coordinate system is Cartesian, right-handed
•	array size = 3
•	unit of measure = degree
•	the transformation is computed by constructing a rotation based on the description below
The three coordinates are a variant of Euler angles, based on the convention that the Cartesian coordinates of the vehicle frame are aligned with LVLH.  The three coordinates are not distances in this coordinate system; rather they are rotation angles around the axes of the coordinate system.  Roll is rotation around the direction of flight (x).  Pitch is rotation around the y axis.  Yaw is rotation around the z axis.  All these rotations use the right-handed convention for sign.</xs:documentation>
				</xs:annotation>
			</xs:enumeration>
			<xs:enumeration value="rotationRate">
				<xs:annotation>
					<xs:documentation>The “rotation rate” value of the “transformation type” term specifies the following information for a semantic type:
•	coordinate system = Cartesian
•	array size = n
•	unit of measure = angle / time
•	the transformation is generally not computed, because this vector is often used directly as a measurement and as a set point for an attitude control system
The vector represents the rate of rotation of the “to frame” relative to the “reference frame”.  The elements of the vector are the angular rates around each axis of the reference frame.  Chirality of the coordinate system must be specified in an electronic data sheet when using this term.  Unit of measure for the rate must also be specified in an electronic data sheet when using this term.</xs:documentation>

•	array size = n
•	unit of measure = length
•	the transformation is computed by adding this vector to the vector in the reference frame
The elements of the vector are interpreted as changes in Cartesian coordinates.  The vector is not a position, but is a translation transformation that can be applied to position vectors by adding the translation coordinates to the position coordinates.  Chirality of the coordinate system must be specified in an electronic data sheet when using this term.  The unit of measure must also be specified in an electronic data sheet when using this term.</xs:documentation>

•	coordinate system = Cartesian
•	array size = n
•	unit of measure = length / time
•	the transformation is generally not computed, because this vector is often used directly as a measurement and as a set point for a navigation system
The vector represents the rate of translation of the “to frame” relative to the “reference frame”.  The elements of the vector are the linear speeds along each axis of the reference frame.  Chirality of the coordinate system must be specified in an electronic data sheet when using this term.  Unit of measure for the speed must also be specified in an electronic data sheet when using this term.</xs:documentation>
