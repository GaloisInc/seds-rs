				\cfesbcmd  Write Pipe Info to a File

				\par  Description
				This command will create a file containing the software bus pipe
				information. The pipe information contains information about every
				pipe that has been created through the #CFE_SB_CreatePipe API. An
				absolute path and filename may be specified in the command.
				If this command field contains an empty string (NULL terminator as
				the first character) the default file path and name is used.
				The default file path and name is defined in the platform
				configuration file as #CFE_PLATFORM_SB_DEFAULT_PIPE_FILENAME.
				\cfecmdmnemonic  \SB_WRITEPIPE2FILE

				\par  Command Structure
				#CFE_SB_WriteFileInfoCmd_t

				\par  Command Verification
				Successful execution of this command may be verified with the
				following telemetry:
				- \b \c \SB_CMDPC - command execution counter will increment.
				- Specified filename created at specified location. See description.
				- The #CFE_SB_SND_RTG_EID debug event message will be generated. All
				debug events are filtered by default.

				\par  Error Conditions
				- Errors may occur during write operations to the file. Possible
				causes might be insufficient space in the file system or the
				filename or file path is improperly specified.
				Evidence of failure may be found in the following telemetry:
				- \b \c \SB_CMDEC - command error counter will increment
				- A command specific error event message is issued for all error
				cases. See #CFE_SB_SND_RTG_ERR1_EID and #CFE_SB_FILEWRITE_ERR_EID

				\par  Criticality
				This command is not inherently dangerous.  It will create a new
				file in the file system and could, if performed repeatedly without
				sufficient file management by the operator, fill the file system.

				\cfesbcmd  Write Map Info to a File

				\par  This command will create a file containing the software bus message
				map information. The message map is a lookup table (an array of
				uint16s)that allows fast access to the correct routing table element
				during a software bus send operation. This is diagnostic
				information that may be needed due to the dynamic nature of the
				cFE software bus. An absolute path and filename may be specified
				in the command. If this command field contains an empty string
				(NULL terminator as the first character) the default file path and
				name is used. The default file path and name is defined in the
				platform configuration file as #CFE_PLATFORM_SB_DEFAULT_MAP_FILENAME.
